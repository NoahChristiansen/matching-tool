Option 2 (Filesystem): configuration changes (optional) If you would like the web application to be able to send mail (e.g. for the reset password form), also modify the MAIL_SERVER , MAIL_USERNAME , MAIL_PASSWORD , and MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER variables. Depending on your mailing setup, MAIL_PORT (default: 465), MAIL_USE_SSL (default: True), MAIL_USE_TLS (default: False) can be overridden. If you don't set any mail environment variables, the reset password form will not work, but the rest of the app will. (optional) Perform Redis tweaks. This is tested on Ubuntu. For other OSes, the method for making these changes may be different. Also, the need these changes may not be there for all OSes; Ubuntu's default configuration is not ideal for Redis within docker.

Data Flow Overview \u00b6 To help with general troubleshooting, it helps to gain some familiarity with how data flows through the application and different containers. Below is a step-by-step overview of data flow. The user uploads a tabular dataset through the webapp UI, which is run by the webapp container. This data goes through the upload_file endpoint and is immediately saved to a temporary directory on the filesystem that is shared with the webapp_worker container. It tells the webapp_worker container to validate the file asynchronously and begins polling the asynchronous job for results. The webapp_worker container runs the validate_async function asynchronously. This saves some metadata about the upload to the upload_log Postgres table and runs a variety of validations on the data. It culminates in uploading the validated and transformed file to storage (S3 by default) at the RAW_UPLOADS_PATHs location, and returns the validation results. Assuming the file has no validation problems and the user clicks 'confirm upload', the merge_file endpoint is called. This loads the stored file into the database under the path raw_{upload_id} and merges it with the 'master' table for the relevant jurisdiction and event type. This 'master' table serves as the source for the results dashboard. Data is sent from here to the matcher, and data from the matcher is synced back into it. The 'merge' consists of adding rows from the new uploaded file that do not have their primary keys (see primaryKey attribute of the relevent schema file present in the master table, and updating data in the master table with any matching rows from the upload. Placeholder matching ids (of format {event_type}_{internal_person_id}) are populated. The 'master' table is exported to storage (at MERGED_UPLOADS_PATH ) and the matcher_worker container is notified (via the do_match function) to begin matching asynchronously. The matcher_container loads all master tables from storage for matching. It loads the matcher_config.yaml file in the container for configuration. The internals of the matching algorithm are outside of the scope of this document, but its data output is written to storage (at BASE_PATH/matched ) , and the webapp_worker is notified of the completed matching job. The webapp_worker container runs the match_finished function to merge the matched data into the master table. The new data is loaded into a temporary table again and joined with the master table on the primary key again, this time just uploading the matched_id column with the new values from the matcher. As the user queries the results dashboard, the master table is queried. General Troubleshooting Tools \u00b6 Below are several general tools you can use to diagnose a variety of problems. These are referred to by many of the specific use cases further down in this document. Querying the Database \u00b6 On installation, Postgres credentials were created and put in webapp.env . Some troubleshooting problems may involve looking in this database. Setting up a database query tool is outside of the scope of this tutorial, but common options are DBeaver or psql (psql can be installed directly on the server). Logging into a container \u00b6 Occasionally you may need to gain access to a shell prompt on one of the containers. You can do so with docker exec -it <containername> /bin/bash . Docker logs \u00b6 Many, many troubleshooting tasks involve looking at application logs. Docker keeps track of the logs from individual docker containers and you can view them with the docker logs command. Try docker logs --help to look at all the options available to filter the logs from a specific container. Beware: some of the containers output a lot of log messages, so you won't want to run them without filtering! Login Issues \u00b6 A user is unable to log in \u00b6 If you have created a user (see Updating the Tool ) but they cannot log in, you can query the webapp's Postgres database . The user information is kept in the public . user table (with their role memberships in the public . roles_users table). That table should have an row with their email address in it. If not, their user was not successfully created and you should create their user again. If they do have a row, ensure that they are logging in with the correct email address. Otherwise there may be a password issue. Although you cannot retrieve their raw password, you may remove their user and roles_users records and create a user with a fresh password for them again. Also, if you have configured the installation to be able to reset passwords (see Installation step 8), they may reset their password through the login page. A user cannot see any upload buttons \u00b6 If a user can log in but cannot see any event type buttons (e.g. HMIS service stays, jail bookings) on the upload page, it means they are not a member of any roles. You can query the webapps' Postgres database public . roles_users table joined to the role and user tables to see what roles they are a member of. SELECT role.name FROM \"user\" JOIN \"roles_users\" ON (\"user\".id = \"roles_users\".user_id) JOIN \"role\" ON (\"role\".id = \"roles_users\".role_id) WHERE email = 'thcrockett@uchicago.edu'; name ---------------------------- default_hmis_service_stays default_jail_bookings (2 rows) In this example, the user thcrockett@uchicago.edu has access to the default_hmis_service_stays and default_jail_bookings roles, which in matching tool parlance translates to hmis_service_stays and jail_bookings event types for the jurisdiction named default . This user should be seeing buttons on the upload page for both of those event types. If the user does not have entries here, you may add them, either through the create user script or through directly modifying the database. If the user does have entries here, refer to the docker logs in the webapp container around when they were using the application. A possible cause of this problem is if the event types they are a part of don't match the schemas listed by the app. For the most up to date list of event types, refer to webapp/schemas/uploader/ . The filenames in that directory (dashes replaced with underscores) are queried by the app and make up a whitelist of event types. Any event type the user is associated with that doesn't match that list will be ignored by the application. Upload Issues \u00b6 System failure \u00b6 Although the majority of messages that users will see coming from the upload portion of the tool should be validation errors (user-fixable, referenced in the Users section of the guide), occasionally they may see a message that indicates a 'System Failure'/'System Error' and they need to come to you for help. In this case, there is something that failed during the upload process in a way that the system did not expect. You should look at the docker logs for both the webapp and webapp_worker containers that cover the period that the user was using the tool. If there's a lot of output, you can filter to 'ERROR' messages (e.g. docker logs webapp | grep ERROR ), though often the messages surrounding an error message will give helpful context. Matching Issues \u00b6 Matching Failure \u00b6 If a user reports that the app's timeline indicates that a matching job failed, you can look at the docker logs for the matcher_worker container. Warning: The matcher outputs a lot of log messages, you will likely want to heavily filter the logs. For instance, just looking at the last 100 lines or so (e.g. docker logs matcher_worker --tail 100 would let you see any errors that were thrown and stopped the matching job. Matching Oddities \u00b6 Sometimes, the matching process may complete but the results look weird. Often this may show itself in the form of matching results being far lower than expected, and is corroborated by placeholder match ids (the placeholder format is {event_type}_{person_id} , e.g. hmis_service_stays_123897124 showing up in the webapp results dashboard. This means that the database table that the webapp uses to populate the dashboard did not receive all of the rows of matching results it expected to receive. The reasons for this can be divided into two possibilities: Either the matcher's results (that are saved to S3) were incorrect, or they were loaded incorrectly. To find out which, compare the length of the matcher's results to the length of the corresponding database table. The matcher's results are located under the BASE_PATH (defined webapp.env)/matched key/file. The database table to query is {jurisdiction}_{event_type}_master . If the matcher results are shorter, then a problem happened with the matching service or prior to that. You can perform the same type of length check on the matcher's input at BASE_PATH/merged to ensure that the matcher received the correct length dataset. If the matcher's input and output are not the same length, you will have to dig into the matcher logs. If the matcher's input and output are the same length, then a problem happened while exporting the master table to place where the matcher reads it. Check the webapp logs for any errors that may have happened while doing this. If the results are the same length, then a problem happened while joining the matching results into the database. Check the webapp_worker logs for any messages that match those under the (match_finished)[https://github.com/dssg/matching-tool/blob/master/webapp/webapp/tasks.py#L395-L430] code path.","title":"Troubleshooting"},{"location":"admin/troubleshooting/#data-flow-overview","text":"To help with general troubleshooting, it helps to gain some familiarity with how data flows through the application and different containers.

To find out which, compare the length of the matcher's results to the length of the corresponding database table. The matcher's results are located under the BASE_PATH (defined webapp.env)/matched key/file. The database table to query is {jurisdiction}_{event_type}_master . If the matcher results are shorter, then a problem happened with the matching service or prior to that. You can perform the same type of length check on the matcher's input at BASE_PATH/merged to ensure that the matcher received the correct length dataset. If the matcher's input and output are not the same length, you will have to dig into the matcher logs. If the matcher's input and output are the same length, then a problem happened while exporting the master table to place where the matcher reads it.

This document provides an overview of the matching process (including how to configure the specific steps using the matcher configuration file ), and guidelines on how to make changes under common circumstances. Overview of the Matching Process \u00b6 When a user successfully uploads a new data file to the webapp, the webapp calls do_match() to begin a new matching job, instructing the matcher about which files to match and where to find them. From this point, the matching process proceeds like this: Load and combine event data: load_data_for_matching() loads and combines into a single data frame all of the data files passed by the webtool, retaining only the columns specified in the keys section of the matcher configuration file. This section of the configuration file is a simple list, where each line should begin with a - and contain the name of a column that is shared by all of the schemas to be matched: keys: # Which columns to select for matching - first_name - middle_name - last_name - dob - ssn - dmv_number - dmv_state - race - ethnicity - sex Exact deduplication: Before beginning the algorithmic matching process, we drop all rows that are exact duplicates of another row on the matching keys (e.g., match exactly on first name, last name, date of birth, social security number, gender, and race). Preprocessing: The deduplicated data are then sent to preprocess.py to be cleaned and to enforce data types. Any data cleaning rules (e.g., cleaning out punctuation from strings, removing white space, converting data types) should be added to this file. Record linkage: From here, the matching algorithm proceeds by breaking the data into smaller subsets (blocking), generating contrasts on each of these subsets, and then clustering records into matched groups using a split-apply-combine methodology. Each of these steps is described below. Blocking: Comparing all records to each other is wasteful. Most record pairs are not true matches. We can identify subsets of record pairs that are more likely to contain matches and only make comparisons on them, saving both computation time and memory. The matcher uses blocking to do this, subsetting the records into a dictionary smaller dataframes based on the the blocking keys in the matcher configuration file. Blocking rules should be entered as a dictionary of key-value pairs, where each key is a name of a column, and each value is the number of characters to use for blocking. For example, the rule dob: 3 includes all people who share the first three \"letters\" of their date of birth (i.e., their decade of birth when dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format) in the same block. Records are only compared to each other if they share values on all of the keys. blocking_rules: last_name: 2 dob: 3 first_name: 1 Indexing: Blocks with a single record will be assigned a unique matched id and skip the remaining matching steps. For each block with more than one record, the matcher identifies all unique record pairs . If the block includes Jon, Jane, and Joe, it will compare Jon with Jane, Jon with Joe, and Jane with Joe, but it will ignore self-comparisons like Jon with Jon or duplicate comparisons like Jane with Jon. Contrasting: Next, the matcher will use the contraster compare the records' values on the preprocessed columns (e.g., how different are the first names in a pair of records?). The contraster contains several methods for making comparisons on a column in the preprocessed data. Several methods are wrappers for contrast methods available in the recordlinkage package. New types of contrasts can be created by adding methods to the contraster. Configuring the contrasts is a matter of specifying in a dictionary which methods you would like to call on each preprocessed column, and what arguments, if any, you would like to pass to that method. The top level keys are the names of the preprocessed columns you want to make comparisons on. The values for these keys are lists of dictionaries with the keys method and args (optional, a dictionary of arguments to be passed to the named method). Each method / args pair should be preceded by a - to indicate that it is an item in the list. The following configuration will make three contrasts on the first_name field (do the first names match exactly? do the first names have exactly the same first 5 letters? how far apart are the first names using the Jaro-Winkler metric ?) and two comparisons on the race field (do the two records share any races? do they share all of their races?): contrasts: first_name: - method: compare_exact - method: compare_exact args: n_chars: 5 - method: compare_string_distance args: method: jarowinkler race: - method: compare_list args: method: any - method: compare_list args: method: all It is important to note here that including a column in the keys section of the configuration will ensure that it is used for exact deduplication in step 2, but if you would like it to be used in the record linkage process, you must include one or more contrasts on that column. In addition, if you rename a column or create a new column in any changes to the preprocessing step, you will need to add a key and contrasts for that column to the contrasts section of the configuration file. Scoring: The contrasts step creates many different comparisons for a pair of records; the scoring step combines all of these comparisons into a single distance score that summarizes how different the two records are, with lower scores indicating more similar records. The matcher has several options for scoring when it calls the compactify() function. The default in the matcher itself is to take the simple mean of all of the contrast values. This can be changed by changed the operation parameter when the compactify() function is called and/or by adding new operations to the compactify() function. Clustering and assigning matched_ids: To determine which groups of records belong to a single person, the matcher uses a clustering algorithm . Which algorithm it uses and the hyperparameters of the algorithm are specified in the clusterer section of the matcher config . This section should contain an installed method as a top level key and a dictionary of args to pass to that method. clusterer: method: sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN args: eps: 0.2 min_samples: 1 algorithm: auto leaf_size: 30 n_jobs: 4 The matcher has only been tested with scikit-learn's implementation of DBSCAN and will not work with any other method without making code changes to the clusterer . Saving results and notifying the webapp: Once the record linkage step is done, the matcher has a dataframe of deduplicated and matched records. To complete its output , it re-loads the original source data and joins the matched ids to each table's primary key, writing the results to a file named matched in the same directory as the merged data it received from the webapp. It then notifies the webapp that its job is complete, so the webapp can upload the new matched_ids to the database and make the results available to end users. Common Adjustments to the Matcher \u00b6 Adding or Increasing Use of a Data Field \u00b6 If you would like to add a new field to the matcher algorithm, you will need to add it in multiple places in the matcher configuration file . The column name should be listed as a key in the keys section of the configuration file. This will cause it to be used for exact deduplication and to be included in the data sent to the matcher algorithm. You may also wish to add pre-processing steps to reformat the data before matching. To compare records on this field in the matcher, you will need to add contasts to the contrasts section of the configuration file. Because the default behavior of the matcher when it calls the compactify() function is to take a simple average of the contrasts, adding more contrasts for a field adds more weight to that field. For example, in the default configuration file , there are six comparisons for first name but only one comparison for middle name, meaning that the matcher weights the first name six times as strongly as the middle name. If we wanted to weight middle name higher, we could add additional contrasts on the middle name, such as examining the Jaro-Winkler distance between the middle names in a pair of records. Note that if you add the same contrast multiple times for a single data field, they will overwrite each other rather than being used multiple times. You can see what a newly added contrast looks like and how it affects the scores by examining the cached contrasts in the match_cache/contrasts folder in the jurisdiction's root storage directory. Manually assigning weights to each contrast would require code changes to the compactify() function to support weighting (and to allow for user input of weighting). Removing or Decreasing Use of a Data Field \u00b6 If you would like to remove a field from the matcher algorithm completely, you will need to remove it from both the keys and the contrasts sections of the matcher configuration file . The column name should be listed as a key in the keys section of the configuration file. If you simply would like decrease how much that matcher uses the data field, you should remove contrasts for that field. Because the default behavior of the matcher when it calls the compactify() function is to take a simple average of the contrasts, removing some of the contrasts for a field will decrease the weight to that field. For example, in the default configuration file , there are six comparisons for first name but only one comparison for middle name, meaning that the matcher weights the first name six times as strongly as the middle name. If we wanted to decrease the relative weight of the first name, we could remove contrasts on the first name, such as only comparing the exact first name and its Jaro-Winkler distance. Then, first name would only be counted twice as much as middle name. However, we would also have changed how we use first name by discregarding partial string comparisons on the first and last 3 and 5 letters. You can see how this change affects the scores by examining the cached contrasts in the match_cache/contrasts folder in the jurisdiction's root storage directory. Manually assigning weights to each contrast would require code changes to the compactify() function to support weighting (and to allow for user input of weighting). Stopping the Matcher from Caching so Many Files \u00b6 The matcher stores a lot of information in its cache to allow you to diagnose problems and test how changes to the configuration affect different stages of the process (e.g., what does a newly added contrast look like? how does it affect the scores?). These are stored in the match_cache folder in your base directory. This folder can be occasionally cleared to remove the backlog of files. If you find the space used by the matcher excessive, or if you are not making changes to the matching algorithm that you want to test, you may want to disable much of this caching. To do this remove or comment out the lines in the matcher where it writes these files to disk using the write_dataframe() function: cluster.py caches the squared distance matrix and the raw cluster ids for each block, so there are two lines to remove. matcher.py caches the contrasts for each block. ioutils.py caches the loaded, deduplicated data. preprocess.py caches the preprocessed data to allow you to examine the affect of preprocessing on the raw data. Note: Only remove write_dataframe() calls writing to the match_cache . Other writes are critical to the function of the matching tool.","title":"Modifying the Matching Service"},{"location":"dev/matching/#updating-the-matching-service","text":"Modifying the matching service is neccesary if you would like to change or improve matching results, experiment on matching algorithm configurations, speed up the matching process, or make other changes to how matching is done.

Copying an example from one of the existing schemas is recommended. The important parts of the schema: The top-level name field simply contains a human-readable name for the schema. This is used in the web UI. The fields field contains a list of column names, their datatypes, and any necessary constraints on them. If you have questions about standard constraints that are not clear from the existing .json files, refer to the goodtables-py docs (the general library used by the matching tool). If a field is intended to be matched with a field from existing schemas, use the same field names, types, and constraints for that field from the existing schemas. The matcher will assume that these are formatted similarly, and you can get poor results if this isn't true. The primaryKey field contains a list of column names that uniquely identify a row in the schema. This is important to get right, as this primary key is enforced in the database. If a new row is uploaded that matches the primary key of an existing row, that row will be updated with the information from the new row . So ensure that you include enough fields from the schema to uniquely identify events of the event type you are concerned with. For instance, the jail_bookings schema can include different rows for different location changes within the jail. Therefore, it has location_start_date as part of its primaryKey. (recommended) Update the schema test file with the name of this new schema, and run this test to ensure that your schema doesn't have any structural errors. This helps to do up front as otherwise the error will show up as an internal server error when attempting to upload a file. To test it: Install pip . pip install virtualenv cd webapp virtualenv venv source venv/bin/activate pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements_dev.txt PYTHONPATH='.' py.test webapp/tests/test_schemas.py Open the webapp.validations module. The CHECKS_BY_SCHEMA dictionary is where you should add this schema, and a list of the checks that should be activated. Simply making it STANDARD_CHECKS is a good start for schemas that are designed to be similar to the shipped schemas. In the basic case, this is all you should have to do in this file. If you want to add any checks that contain custom logic, you can define them in this file. We will not include a custom check tutorial here, but the examples in that file (any function with the '@check' decorator) and the goodtables-py docs will be helpful. Open the matcher config and make any changes needed. Refer to the guide on changing the matching config for details, but of note if there are columns in your new schema that you wish to use for matching that aren't present in existing schemas you will have to add them here and configure how they will be used for matching. Have your administrator install the new code (new schema+validation file updates), and add your user to the new event type : the event type will be the name of the .json file, dashes replaced with underscores. Alternately, if you have a local installation you can do those steps yourself. At this point, you should be able to upload new files for this schema type, the matcher should be able to produce results, and you can download these results with the original source data with match ids in the results dashboard ('Download Source Events', bottom of the left control panel). Limitations when creating a new Schema \u00b6 Creating a new schema does not make its events show up on the results dashboard . The logic for populating the Venn diagrams and results table are highly customized for HMIS Service Stays and Jail Bookings. Adding a third event type to this dashboard raises many interface design questions that are not easy to answer. If you wish to customize this interface, you can refer to Modifying the Webapp but know that at this point your version of the code will be highly customized and it will be tough to receive code updates. It is recommended that you import these source events with match ids into your spreadsheet/reporting tool of choice for visualization.","title":"Creating or Modifying a Schema"},{"location":"dev/schemas/#creating-or-modifying-a-schema","text":"The matching tool can be extended to work with schemas not defined in the initial release.

The tool is fed tabular data, which is securely stored and matched with data from other systems within the same jurisdiction. The tool then displays results from the matched data to find overlaps between the populations and frequent utilizers of both systems. Browser Support \u00b6 The web app is tested on the following browsers: Firefox 52 and above Chrome 61 IE 11 If you test with any other browsers, add them to this list! Login Page \u00b6 This is the first page of the tool. Accessing the tool requires a registered email address and password combination. This must be entered and submitted in the form on the Login page, as seen in Figure 1. After entering the details, click \"Login\" to be directed to the Home Page. Figure 1: Login Page Home Page \u00b6 The first page that a user will see after logging in is the Home page of the Web based tool that explains the two major steps of the tool process, which are Upload and Results . On the right of the Home page is a column that provides a list of successful and unsuccessful tasks (no errors while uploading tabular data) that have been processed or are currently being processed by the matching tool. This ticker on the right of the Home web page provides the status and duration times for the matching, validation and uploading of each file. Figure 2: Matching Tool Home Page Uploading Data \u00b6 In order to upload data onto the matching tool, the following steps must be carried out. Step 1: Select Upload Data \u00b6 On the Home page, the user will be directed to the uploading page after selecting Upload from the Home page, as seen in Figure 3. Here, you will be able to able to upload the data you would like to have matched with data from other systems. Figure 3: Uploading Data Step 2: Choose Data Type \u00b6 After selecting Upload from the Home page, the user will then be taken to the Upload Data Main Page (shown in Figure 4). The user then chooses the type of data that needs to be uploaded. The options are \"HMIS Service Stays\", \u201cJail Bookings\u201d, \u201cJail Booking Charges\u201d, \u201cHMIS AKA/Aliases\u201d, \u201cCase Charges\u201d or \u201cBy-name list\u201d as seen in Figure 4. Figure 4: Upload Data Main Page Step 3: Upload File \u00b6 Allows you to browse computer files for upload. File needs to be tabular (CSV is preferred) and represent user data from an existing county system. This data will be stored securely and matched with existing data from other county systems Figure 5: Select and Upload File Step 4: Validate File \u00b6 The matching tool checks that the required fields and formats of the uploaded file satisfies the necessary requirements. Failed Uploads: The most common error encountered with the tool would be because of an unknown delimiter used in the file. Only commas (,) or pipes (|) are permitted. You can also download the report in a CSV format by clicking \"Download Full Error Report\". Figure 6 gives an example of a common upload failing. Figure 6: Failed Upload - Unknown Delimiter If instead you encounter a System error as seen in Figure 7, please contact your system administrator. Figure 7: Failed Upload - System Error Successful Uploads: If the data is validated successfully, then the screen will present the first 10 rows of the uploaded data and the total number of rows found. After reviewing the first 10 rows, the user has the option to confirm or cancel the upload. Figure 8 gives an example of an upload confirmation. Figure 8: Successful Upload Step 5: Confirm Upload and Return to Home Page \u00b6 After you have confirmed your upload, the next screen will show the number of total unique rows and the total number of rows that had not been uploaded before. You can then go back to the home page and see your data being processed on the ticker. Figure 9: Final Upload Confirmation Results Page \u00b6 The Results page provides a summary of the results based on the data uploaded and matched from the County\u2019s jail bookings and HMIS stays. Each of the data fields can be clicked on to sort the data based on the field specified in either ascending or descending order.
