## Issues

Whether it be an unexpected error, a design flaw, a typo in documentation, or a desired feature, we track all potential changes to the code in Github Issues. Our issues page is at https://github.com/dssg/matching-tool/issues - do a search first to see if the issue has been mentioned before. If so, feel free to add any new information or even just let the community know that you are experiencing the same problem.

If your issue doesn't exist yet, [create it!](https://github.com/dssg/matching-tool/issues/new) Try and be as detailed as possible.

If it's an unexpected error, the following types of information can be helpful:

- what page you were on
- the steps you took up until finding the error
- a screenshot of the page at error time
- any [browser console errors](https://kb.yoast.com/kb/how-to-find-javascript-errors-with-your-browsers-console/)
- any [server-side errors](https://dssg.github.io/matching-tool/admin/troubleshooting/#general-troubleshooting-tools) that your systems administrator was able to find

On the other hand, if it's an idea for a new feature or design change you'd like to make, the following information will help discussion:

- What problem would this change solve?
- Would this change help all users of the tool?
