# matching-tool
Integrating HMIS and criminal-justice data


Much of the useful information for users, administrators, and developers is located at the [Documentation Site](https://dssg.github.io/matching-tool/). This README will be pretty bare to avoid documentation being changed in one place and becoming stale elsewhere.

## Contributing
If you make changes to the code that are appropriate to share with all counties, please open a pull request. The request will be reviewed by the development team at the Center for Data Science and Public Policy before being approved and merged.
